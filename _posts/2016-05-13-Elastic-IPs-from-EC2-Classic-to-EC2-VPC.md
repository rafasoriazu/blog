### Amazon AWS

There are some amazon instances that can be launched only in an EC2-VPC.
If you want to attach one of your new EC2-VPC instances to an elastic IP that has already been attached to an EC2-classic instance, you will have to move the Elastic IP from EC2-Classic to EC2-VPC.

## Instance Types Available Only in a VPC

There are some instances that are only available in a VPC

* C4
* M4
* T2

[List of instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html#vpc-only-instance-types)

## Elastic IPs are different for EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC

You can't associate directly an Elastic IP address that you allocated for use with a VPC with an instance in EC2-Classic, and vice-versa. 

[More info...](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html#VPC_EIP_EC2_Differences)


## Moving elastic IPs from EC2-Classic to EC2-VPC

* Only in the same region
* You canâ€™t migrate an Elastic IP initially reserved for EC2-VPC
* The Elastic IP must be detached from any instance
* This migration has to be carried out from the [CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/es/cli)
